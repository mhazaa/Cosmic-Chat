Cosmic Chat is a a visual, atmospheric multiplayer world where users can explore and chat with each other. It allows up to 50 players in each room with real-time feedback. I used Pixi.js; WebGL rendering library to build the front-end. For the back-end infrastructure I used Node and web sockets.

If you're interested in my process for creating the all the art, assets, and music for this project. I go through it more on my website.
